## Black Rain - A color scheme for [Atom](https://atom.io/)

> This is a port of the Sublime Text color scheme [BlackRain](https://github.com/ginfuru/BlackRain) which in turn is based off of the [enlightened](https://github.com/vincentmac/enlightened) theme.

This color scheme, _(theme)_, looks great with Atom's One Dark UI. I personally haven't tested it with any others but I'm sure [Atom Material UI](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-ui) will look great.

## Available for:

- [X] [Sublime Text](https://github.com/ginfuru/Sublime-BlackRain)
- [X] [iTerm 2](https://ginfuru/iTerm-BlackRain)
- [ ] Mou/MacDown
- [ ] Vim/MacVim
